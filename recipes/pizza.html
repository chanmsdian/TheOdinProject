        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol style="border: solid 1px;border-radius:10px;padding:20px">
                <li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand
                for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</li>
                <li>Sift flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients;
                stir in yeast mixture. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth
                and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a
                light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1
                hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and
                pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sauce has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide dough into two equal pieces--do
                not tear. Shape dough into rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form dough into rectangles, and place onto prepared
                baking sheet. Spoon tomato sauce over dough. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese; top with bell pepper, onion, and
                mushroom. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over top.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp and cheese has melted, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
